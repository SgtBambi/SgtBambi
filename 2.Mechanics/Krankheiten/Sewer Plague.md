### Sewer Plague

Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as [rats](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rat?expansion=0#content) and [otyughs](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Otyugh?expansion=0#content).  
  
When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 [Constitution](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_23) [saving throw](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_35) or become infected.  
  
It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of [exhaustion](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=0#toc_15), and it regains only half the normal number of [hit points](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=0#toc_47) from spending [Hit Dice](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Character%20Advancement#toc_6) and no hit points from finishing a [long rest](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Resting?expansion=0#toc_2).  
  
At the end of each [long rest](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Resting?expansion=0#toc_2), an infected creature must make a DC 11 [Constitution](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_23) [saving throw](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_35). On a failed save, the character gains one level of [exhaustion](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=0#toc_15). On a successful save, the character’s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.
