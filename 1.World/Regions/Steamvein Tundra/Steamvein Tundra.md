# Dampfader Tundra
### Geography & Icework  
- A near-featureless expanse of compressed ice and snow, stretching for hundreds of kilometers.  
- Beneath the smooth surface lies a labyrinth of heat-carved tunnels and fissures, glowing faintly with steam.  
- Surface travel is perilous: hidden chasms may open without warning, swallowing unwary travelers.  

### Remorhaz Breeding Grounds  
- The Expanse serves as one of the remorhaz’s principal hatcheries under D&D 5e rules.  
- Enormous, heat-generating adults burrow through the ice to create nesting caverns at various depths.  
- Clutches of eggs lie deep within, incubated by the creature’s own body warmth.  

### Ecology & Climate  
- The constant geothermal activity of remorhaz warrens thins and reshapes the ice from below.  
- Steam vents and superheated fissures dot the plain, creating localized microclimates of near-tropical warmth.  
- Few othe
