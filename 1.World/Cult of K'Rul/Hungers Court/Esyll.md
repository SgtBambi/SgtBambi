**Seeks:** _Gulgrin, the Devourer’s Tooth_
**Appearance:** A willowy figure always half-shadowed by a long hood; Esyll’ra’s skin has the sheen of porcelain that’s been submerged and left too long — pale, faintly translucent, with visible ink-blue veins at the temples. Her fingers are long and needle-fine, tipped with glossy black ridges that look like tiny teeth rather than nails. She dresses in swallow-tail capes and a collar embroidered with microblades sewn into the hem; her voice, when she uses it, sounds like paper sliding in the dark. Around her throat hang dozens of tooth-shaped charms made of bone and glass, each humming with a faint, private sound.  
**Signature:** She lures confidences like birds into a net — then plucks the memory that matters most and leaves the rest to rot.
