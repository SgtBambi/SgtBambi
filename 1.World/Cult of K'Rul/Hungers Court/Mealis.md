## Traits

**Spellcasting (Warlock 17).** Mealis is a 17th-level warlock. Charisma is his spellcasting ability (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). He has Pact Magic (slot level 5) and the following typical spells prepared:

- **Cantrips (at will):** _eldritch blast_ (3 beams), _mage hand_, _minor illusion_
    
- **1st–5th (Pact slots, cast at 5th level unless noted):** _hex, armor of Agathys, darkness, mirror image, hunger of hadar, hold monster, banishment, counterspell_
    
- **Mystic Arcanum (1/day each):** 6th _true seeing_, 7th _forcecage_, 8th _demiplane_, 9th _foresight_ (or _imprisonment_)
    

**Eldritch Invocations.** Agonizing Blast, Repelling Blast, Devil’s Sight, Lifedrinker, Eldritch Spear.

**Pact Weapon (Ul’Zirith).** Mealis treats Ul’Zirith as his pact weapon. When he hits with it, he uses Charisma for attack and damage rolls.

**Master of the Devoured.** While Mealis is attuned to and holding Ul’Zirith, he can, as a bonus action, expend 1 Insight (see staff below) to grant himself or one willing ally within 30 ft. advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom ability checks and saves for 1 minute and +2 to magical attack rolls if the spells use mental attributes.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Mealis fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Mealis makes one attack with Ul’Zirith and then usually casts a spell.

**Ul’Zirith (Staff).** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d6 + 7 bludgeoning plus 3d6 psychic. After a hit, Mealis can trigger _Mind Leech_ once without spending the staff’s Cognition (see staff mechanics) — target must succeed on an Intelligence or Wisdom saving throw (DC 19) or lose 1 point of the chosen ability (Int or Wis; DM chooses based on which talent is more valuable to the target). The lost point is temporary and can be restored by _greater restoration_ or by the staff returning Cognition.

**Eldritch Blast.** Ranged Spell Attack: +11 to hit, range 120 ft., three beams. Hit: 1d10 + 5 force/psychic each. (Mealis uses Repelling Blast tactically.)

**Mind Spear (Recharge 5–6).** Mealis launches a spear of concentrated thought in a 5-ft-wide, 60-ft line. Each creature in the line must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC 19). On a failed save, a creature takes 8d8 psychic damage and loses 1 temporary point of Intelligence for 1 hour; on a successful save, it takes half damage and suffers no temporary loss. For each point of Intelligence (or Wisdom) stolen from a creature by this attack, Ul’Zirith gains 1 Cognition (see staff).

## Reactions

**Counterlash.** When a creature casts a spell targeting Mealis within 60 ft., he can use his reaction to impose disadvantage on the spell attack or on the caster’s saving throw (if the spell requires one). If the spell fails because of this reaction, Mealis may cause Ul’Zirith to attempt to siphon 1 Cognition from the caster (Int/Wis save DC 19; success: no siphon; failure: caster loses 1 point of the targeted ability and the staff gains 1 Cognition).

## Legendary Actions

Mealis can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Mealis regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

- **Eldritch Shot.** Mealis makes one _eldritch blast_ beam attack. (Costs 1)
    
- **Thought Pull.** (Costs 1) Mealis pulls one creature he can see within 30 ft. 15 ft. toward him; the creature must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be pulled and be restrained until the end of its next turn.
    
- **Cognitive Theft.** (Costs 2) Target one creature Mealis can see that is concentrating or a spellcaster with at least one prepared spell slot. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC 19) or lose 1 point of the relevant mental ability (Int or Wis) for 1 minute; Mealis converts the lost point into 1 Cognition stored in Ul’Zirith (if Mealis controls the staff). (Mealis can use this only once per round.)

## Tactical Notes (for DM)

Mealis opens fights by creating zones of darkness (_darkness_ + Devil’s Sight), casting _hunger of hadar_ to control space, and using _eldritch blast_ with Repelling Blast to herd foes into his zones. His priority is to target spellcasters first to harvest Intelligence/Wisdom with Ul’Zirith. If pressed, he uses _forcecage_/_demiplane_ to isolate and feed victims to the staff. Use legendary actions to break the party’s rhythm and force them to split attention between Mealis and the staff’s theft.
