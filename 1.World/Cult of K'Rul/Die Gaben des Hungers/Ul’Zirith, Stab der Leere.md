_Artifact (cursed), legendary (requires attunement)._

**Appearance.** A matte-black staff, slender and cold to the touch. Its top is an open ring that looks into a swirling void. Tiny, ghostly motes sometimes drift out and back into that ring.

**Weapon.** +2 quarterstaff. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit (if wielder is proficient), 1d6 bludgeoning + magical effects (attacker uses Charisma for attack/damage rolls if Ul’Zirith is the wielder’s pact weapon).

**Resources.**

- **Cognition (0–10).** Stored mental energy gathered by siphoning Intelligence or Wisdom from creatures (see _Mind Leech_). Cognition is not regained automatically; it is gained primarily by siphons and by specific staff reactions.
    
- **Insight (0–5).** A converted, ready-to-use resource derived from Cognition. 1 Cognition can be converted into 1 Insight (the wielder chooses when to convert, up to Insight’s max). Insight is expended to fuel special effects (see below).
    
- **Activation Charges (3).** Separate from Cognition/Insight. The staff regains all Activation Charges at dawn.

## Curse: Binding & Compulsion

- **Attunement Binding.** When a creature attunes to Ul’Zirith, the attunement cannot be ended voluntarily. The staff cannot be willingly dropped, cast off, thrown away, or willingly given to another creature. Physical attempts to remove the staff (disarm, shove, grapple to force drop) require the attacker to succeed on a contested Strength (Athletics) check versus the wielder’s Strength (Athletics) or a Wisdom save (DC 19) by the wielder to resist; the staff fights to stay with its wielder. _Remove curse_ or _greater restoration_ can break the attunement and free the wielder; destroying the staff requires a monumental ritual (see DM section).
    
- **Unwilling Wielder Penalty.** If the wielder fails the initial attunement check (Intelligence saving throw DC 17 determined by DM when first touching/attempting to attune), they are an _uncontrolled attuned wielder_. An uncontrolled attuned wielder loses 1 Intelligence point at the end of each long rest until the staff gains at least 1 Cognition, or until the wielder succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw (one attempt per long rest). These Intelligence losses are cumulative and require _greater restoration_ to remove, or the staff can return Cognition to the wielder to heal the loss (1 Cognition returns 1 point).

## Staff Abilities

### Mind Leech (Action)

Range 60 ft. Target one creature. The wielder chooses whether the staff attacks the target’s Intelligence or Wisdom. The target must succeed on an Intelligence or Wisdom saving throw (Wielders Spellsave DC or 18, whciever is higher).

- **Fail:** the target takes 4d8 psychic damage and loses 1d4 points from the chosen ability (Int or Wis). The reduced ability score is temporary (it can only be restored by _greater restoration_ or by the staff converting Cognition back to the victim). Ul’Zirith gains Cognition equal to the points stolen (to a maximum of 10).
    
- **Success:** the target takes half damage, and the staff gains 1 Cognition.
    

> Notes: the temporary reduction behaves like any other temporary ability-score reduction: it can break spells or skill uses that require a certain minimum, and it can be healed by _greater restoration_.

### Thoughtfeed (Bonus Action)

When Cognition is gained by Mind Leech, the wielder may immediately convert 1 Cognition into 1 Insight (up to Insight max 5). The wielder can convert stored Cognition into Insight on their turn as a bonus action (1 Cognition → 1 Insight). Insight is consumed to power the staff’s active effects.

### Insight Expenditures

- **1 Insight (Bonus Action):** Gain advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill checks (your choice) for 1 minute.
    
- **2 Insight (Action):** Add 3d6 psychic damage to one attack or spell; if the target is a spellcaster, it also suffers a -1 penalty to the chosen mental ability (Int or Wis) for 1 minute (not cumulative from repeated uses in short time).
    
- **x Insight (Action):** Restore one expended spell slot up to fith Level, this costs as much insight as spell level.
    
- **5 Insight (Action, extreme).** The wielder can attempt a combined _detect thoughts_ (heightened) and short-term domination on one humanoid (like a 1-minute _dominate_ effect limited to social commands). Target gets an Intelligence save (DC as above); on a failed save it is charmed and under the wielder’s mental influence for 1 minute. Use sparingly.

### Cognition Bonus (Passive)

For every 2 Cognition stored in the staff, the wielder gains **+1** to spell attack rolls and **+1** to spell save DCs (up to a maximum of +5 when the staff holds 10 Cognition). These bonuses apply to any spells the wielder casts that use Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as their casting stat.

### Thought Buffer (Reaction, costs 1 Activation Charge)

When a spell is cast at the wielder, they can spend 1 Activation Charge to blunt the spell’s effect: the spell’s effect is halved (damage or duration halved, or a control effect lasts half as long). If the caster is a creature with an Int/Wis score, the staff attempts to siphon 1 Cognition from the caster (Int/Wis save DC as above; fail gives the staff 1 Cognition; success prevents siphon).

### Void Step (Bonus Action; costs 1 Insight **or** 1 Cognition + 1 Activation Charge)

Teleport up to 60 ft. to a place you can see that is in dim light or darkness. On arrival, all creatures in a 10-ft radius must make the appropriate save (Int or Wis, DC as above) or each lose 1 point of the relevant ability score (temporary) and take 2d8 psychic damage (half on success). Use this sparingly—it is expensive.
