### **Overview**

Just outside Skyhold Gate lies **Krag-Vhal**, a mixed-species settlement that acts as a trade hub, supply depot, and staging ground for mercenaries and travelers.

- **Population:** Approx. **25,000** (Mixed races: Dwarves, Humans, Goliaths, Half-Orcs, Elves, and exiled Underdark denizens).
    
- **Role:** Acts as a **buffer zone**, ensuring Dornak-Thulâ€™s gates are never **directly** attacked without warning.
    
- **Architecture:** A mix of **Dwarven stonework** and **makeshift structures** created by non-Dwarven settlers.
    

### **Notable Locations**

- **The Emberhall:** A grand drinking hall where adventurers and mercenaries gather to hear about bounties and Underdark threats.
    
- **The Shield Market:** A sprawling bazaar selling Dwarven weaponry, exotic goods, and magical artifacts from the Underdark.
    
- **The Hollow Refuge:** A sanctuary for lost or exiled beings, operated by a **neutral guild** that mediates conflicts between races.
    

### **Defensive Role**

- The settlement is **surrounded by a palisade** and defended by a **volunteer militia**, consisting of mercenaries and skilled settlers.
    
- Secret tunnels connect **Krag-Vhal** to Dornak-Thul, allowing **emergency evacuations** and military reinforcements when needed.
