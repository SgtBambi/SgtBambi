**Crystalline Carapace.** The scorpion's crystalline plating grants resistance to nonmagical physical weapons (see Resistances).

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The scorpion makes two attacks: one with its pincer and one with its tail (or two pincers if it chooses).

**Pincer.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (3d8 + 7) slashing. On a hit the target is grappled (escape DC 18). The scorpion has two pincers; a creature can be grappled by only one pincer at a time.

**Tail Sting.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 36 (6d10 + 7) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution save or take 21 (6d6) poison damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Crystal Burst (Recharge 5–6).** The scorpion slams its tail into the ground, causing a burst of razor-shattered crystal in a 60-ft. cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 18 Dexterity save, taking 56 (16d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Creatures that fail the save are also knocked prone.

### Legendary Actions
The scorpion can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The scorpion regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

- **Tail Snap.** The scorpion makes a Tail Sting attack.  

- **Shard Shot.** Ranged attack: the scorpion fires crystalline shards in a line 30 ft. long and 5 ft. wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 18 Dexterity save, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.  

- **Eruptive Shift.** The scorpion moves up to 30 ft. without provoking opportunity attacks. If it ends this movement adjacent to a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Strength save or be knocked prone.

**Tactical Notes (for the DM)**  
- Use the scorpion's burrow and tremorsense to reposition and ambush.  
- Crystal Burst + Shard Shot punish clustered parties. Add smaller crystal scorpions to keep the PCs moving.  
- Legendary Resistance + high saves makes it resilient to control effects; encourage players to combine control + burst damage.
