Grak gulag Gubra, thak Azollan’s tzat shivkoth. Rak niul. Zrukon daav zrak, zugrath thuul ozhok. Durlag Golgokk — kruk doruk thuul? Ha.

Mugrak agok skrin, guk daztrak. Gulguk thrak, guk zrakvazr thuul. Shugg thruk, sholog oth dargrak. Gruzzark thrak will. Zrak thuul ogg nazg, zog oth Gol Azollan. Naak thuul!

Gol Thrak-ul gazrak oth shorg. Golzath oth starshakkra, krugg oth murgra, thrak ogragvazr. Shol thuul rukoth thakk Starbane.

Gruuk oth thuul. Zugrug oth muurk.

Gubra, priestess, tool of Azollan. The task is simple. The gate waits.

21 souls must be gathered, unwilling. They must be broken, not with crude force, but through suffering and despair. Their wills must shatter like glass. Only then will they serve your Master Azollan. 

The gaze of the Father of Hunger, is on you. The mouth beneath the dying stars hungers, and only true worship will give you his favor. He will know you through your actions.

Open the gate call forth your master.

Maelis, the Dark Star
