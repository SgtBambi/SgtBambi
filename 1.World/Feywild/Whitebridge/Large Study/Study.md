# Large Study

- A dark, towering study lined with shelves and cluttered with scrolls, papers, and alchemical implements.  
- Laurethil spends hours here planning, researching, and scheming to regain favor with the Winter Queen.

## Desk
- ****Half-Written Letter from the Winter Queen**  
	Laurethil,  

	The threads of my design extend beyond the bounds you dare to tread, and your meddling has frayed more than you perceive.  
	Ambition untempered courts peril, and yet I have indulged your presence as a curious ripple upon the currents of my dominion.  
	
	Heed this: presume not to outpace the pattern I have woven, for the consequences are neither swift nor blunt, but inevitable.  
	There is a path to my notice still, though it winds through shadowed obligations and unseen reckonings.  
	Fail, and the tapestry of your endeavors shall unravel in ways that even your dreams cannot foretell.  
	
	Consider carefully where you place your next step.

### Excerpt from *On the Metaphysics of Dreams and Dream-Based Magic*

The mind is a vessel and a cage; within it, vitality may be drawn if the subject is properly secured in the dream plane.  
The process requires entering the sleeper’s mind during deep slumber, guiding them into a contained dreamspace where they remain immobilized and unaware of the extraction.  

The conduit for this extraction is the **Grasping Yew**, rooted in the everdark.  
The tree requires constant moisture, total darkness, and undisturbed stillness. Its limbs are shaped to suspend the sleeper, while the vines adjust automatically to hold and drain in measured pulses.  
Each victim must be positioned precisely; even slight disturbance disrupts the flow of vitality.  

The Grasping Yew reacts negatively to cold and to light. Exposure to either slows or halts the extraction, and excessive interference may damage the tree or awaken the subject.  
Air must remain humid, shadows unbroken, and activity near the tree minimized. Only under these controlled conditions does the siphoning function efficiently.  

The process is continuous while the sleeper remains bound, and the extracted vitality flows directly into the practitioner’s reservoir.  
Isolation and precise timing are required at all stages to prevent failure. Every aspect of the environment must be maintained; otherwise, the conduit collapses and the subject returns to normal sleep.
